## Building it yourself?

You need to order the parts included in this [csv BOM](../static/bom/BlueMacro840/BlueMacro840.csv).  You can it load in Excel.  The LCSC column refers to the part number at [LCSC.com](https://lcsc.com/).

If you are assembling the BlueMicro840 yourself, refer to the [HTML Bom](../static/bom/BlueMacro840/ibom.html) to help you as you assemble it.
